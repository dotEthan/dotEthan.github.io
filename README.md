# Portfolio Site
[http://dotethan.github.io](http://dotethan.github.io)

After realizing my [previous portfolio site](http://www.ethanstrauss.com) had grown beyond the realm of a "portfolio site", I went back to the drawing board and designed a fresh, simple and interesting design. 

### Status

Finished. Code just needs to be run through babel, minimize, etc.

## Overview and Thoughts

### What Worked

The site looks and acts as I hoped.

### What Didn't Work

I forgot to check [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/) for CSS Grid and originally used it along with Flexbox in the layout. 

The auto importing of images for the main page gallery was built specifically with Grid in mind so I removed it on some older browsers.

## What Lessons Were Learned

Designing first works wonders, but always check browser compatibility.
